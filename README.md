### **Data Distribution**

- **Numerical columns**

[![Numerical columns](./image/numerical_columns.png)](./image/numerical_columns.png)
- **Categorical columns**

[![explicit](./image/explicit.png)](./image/explicit.png)

[![artist_album_track_genre](./image/artist_album_track_genre.png)](./image/artist_album_track_genre.png)

### **Abnormal values and outliers**

- The distribution and the range of values of each column are reasonable. There are no abnormal values
- Boxplot to check outliers
[![Boxplot](./image/boxplot.png)](./image/boxplot.png)

**üìô Comment**

- `popularity`, `acousticness`, `energy`, `valence` have no outliers. (The `popularity` column has 1 outlier, but it is not significant.)
- The remaining columns exhibit a substantial number of outliers, which is understandable as they are all continuous variables. These variables have a wide range of values, do not follow a normal distribution, and are influenced by various factors of a song. Therefore, it is justifiable not to remove these outliers, as they contribute to the diversity and complexity of the dataset, reflecting the diverse nature of musical attributes.
### **Correlation between variables**

- We use correlation matrix and heatmap to check the correlation between variables
[![Correlation matrix](./image/correlation_matrix.png)](./image/correlation_matrix.png)

**üìô Comment**

- The majority of columns exhibit very low correlation with each other, with magnitudes below 0.1.
- The columns with the highest correlation are `energy` and `loudness` with a correlation of 0.76, `loudness` and `acousticness` with a correlation of -0.59, and `energy` and `acousticness` with a correlation of -0.73. This is understandable as the energy of a song is inversely proportional to its acousticness, and the loudness of a song is directly proportional to its energy.
- `popularity` has a low correlation with all other variables, which is understandable as popularity is a subjective measure influenced by factors such as the artist's popularity, release date, and genre.
- `instrumentalness` and `loudness` have a negative correlation of -0.43, which is understandable as instrumental songs tend to be quieter than songs with vocals.
- `danceability` and `valence` have a correlation of 0.43, which is understandable as songs with high valence (positiveness) are more likely to be danceable.

## **_03. Meaningful questions:_**

> **Answer:** There's no single correct answer to the question posed by our group. Answering this question requires looking at it from various perspectives. Each viewpoint provides different responses suitable for that particular aspect. After this analysis, we hope artists can create hits that become even more widely popular.

### **Question 2: How should artists choose their music genres?**

- Purpose: To help artists define their musical identity by guiding them on genre selection. It encourages artists to make informed choices based on their personal style, strengths, diversity exploration, or trending genres. The goal is to assist artists in shaping their artistic identity effectively

- How to answer this question:

    &#x1F4A1; To answer this, we'll break it down into two questions:

    1. **Choosing Personal vs. Trending Genres**:
    
    Should artists pick genres they like or go for what's popular?

    [![venn diagram](./image/venn.png)](./image/venn.png)

    - There's a noticeable overlap between popular music genres and those embraced by renowned artists. Out of 57 popular genres, **35** stand out not just as crowd favorites but also as the chosen realms of passion for celebrated artists. Moreover, these artists venture into 17 different genres, showcasing not only their alignment with trends but also their independence and creativity in discovering unique musical genres with a distinctive personal touch.

    [![popularity of 3 set of genres](./image/popularity_3set.png)](./image/popularity_3set.png)

    2. **Focus vs. Diversification**:

    Is it better for artists to stick to a few genres or expand their genre range?

    - How many genres is considered too many?
    [![distribution_genre](./image/distribution_genre.png)](./image/distribution_genre.png)

    üòä Therefore, we can consider artists with **4** or more genres as those with a diverse range.

    [![top15](./image/top15.png)](./image/top15.png)

    => The popularity distribution among diverse and less diverse artists appears remarkably similar, indicating that the number of genres an artist explores does not significantly impact their popularity.

        
    **Answer**: 
    - If a genre is currently popular, has broad appeal, and aligns with the artist's preferences, they should consider choosing that genre for increased chances of success.

    - If the artist's preferred genre is less popular, they can still pursue it if they have a genuine passion for it. Many successful artists have built substantial fan bases by staying true to their unique style. Additionally, exploring other genres might open up new avenues for career development.

    - The number of genres an artist chooses does not significantly impact their popularity. Taylor Swift, for example, is known for her sweet ballads but has successfully ventured into pop rock, country, and R&B, attracting a diverse fanbase.

    - Artists should avoid frequent genre changes, as this may make it challenging for fans to follow and support them. It's also advisable not to force oneself into a genre they don't enjoy, as it may hinder the creation of high-quality music.

### **Question 3: How can we suggest songs based on a user's current listening preferences?**
- **Benefits:**
    - The goal is to recommend songs to users based on the similarity between songs, helping listeners discover music they might enjoy based on their preferences.
- **How to answer this question:**
    - Utilize Euclidean distance to measure the similarity between songs. The smaller the Euclidean distance, the more similar two songs are from the perspective of the selected features.
    ![Euclidean Distance](./image/Q3-1.png)
    - Select K songs with the smallest distances. These are the songs that the system highly rates in similarity to the user's liked song.
    - Extract information such as song names and artists from the selected songs and return this information as recommendations for the user.

![Recommend](./image/Q3.png)

> **Result:** Recommend the top 5 tracks for the user in descending order of similarity, based on the calculated Euclidean distances.
